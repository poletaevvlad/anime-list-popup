enhancements.

- Allow specifying in which order anime list entries will be shown. Allows

  selected sort order will be preserved between popup openings.

This release introduces new functionality and enhancement, fixes some bugs:

- Users are now able to search through MAL database from the extensions. Found

  rating, or the number of episodes watched.
- Bugfix: Under rare circumstances in poor networking conditions, a list
  section could be duplicated or inserted in the wrong position.
- Bugfix: If a user increments the number of watched episodes to equal the
  total number of episodes for an anime in the completed state, the extension
  erroneously recommends marking it as “watching”.

  unknown, the extension wont suggest marking series as completed.
